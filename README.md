# Console-based Banking System in C
This is a console-based banking system implemented in C. The project allows users to perform various banking operations, including creating accounts, logging in, depositing funds, withdrawing funds, viewing account details, and logging out.

#Features 

1.  #Account Creation: Users can create new accounts by providing an account number and account holder name. The system supports storing multiple accounts, allowing multiple users to use the banking system.
2.  #Login: Users can log in using their account number to access their account. The system verifies the provided account number to ensure secure access.
3.  #Deposit and Withdraw: Logged-in users can deposit and withdraw funds from their account. The system ensures proper validation to prevent invalid transactions. Users can safely manage their funds using these operations.
4.  #Account Details: Users can view their account details, including account number, account holder name, and account balance. This feature provides transparency and allows users to keep track of their account status.
5.  #Error Handling: The system is equipped with proper error handling to provide helpful messages and guide users in case of invalid inputs or other issues. This ensures a smooth and user-friendly experience.
6.  #Dynamic Memory Allocation: The system uses dynamic memory allocation for account creation, allowing the program to manage and store multiple accounts effectively.
7.  #Modular Code Design: The code is organized into functions and separated logically, promoting modularity and readability. This design allows for easy maintenance and extension of the system.
8.  #Graceful Termination: The program ensures proper memory cleanup and exits gracefully when the user chooses to exit, preventing memory leaks.

#How to Use
1. Clone the repository or download the source code files.
2. Compile the C source code using a C compiler (e.g., GCC).
3. Run the compiled executable.
4. The main menu will be displayed, offering options to create an account, log in, or exit the program.
5. If you choose to create an account, enter the account number and account holder name when prompted.
6. To log in, provide the account number associated with your account.
7. Once logged in, the logged-in menu will be displayed, allowing you to perform banking operations.
8. Choose the desired operation (deposit, withdraw, view account details, log out, or exit the program) from the logged-in menu.

#Improvements

The project aims to provide a simple and interactive console-based banking system in C. However, keep in mind that this is a basic implementation and lacks some of the features and security measures present in real-world banking systems. For further development, you can consider adding the following enhancements:

1. Data Encryption: Implement data encryption methods to ensure sensitive information is securely stored and transmitted.
2. Database Integration: Use a database system to store and manage account information persistently.
3. Multi-User Support: Extend the system to handle multiple users simultaneously.
4. Error Handling: Improve error handling and input validation to enhance the system's reliability and user-friendliness.
